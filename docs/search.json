    "text": "UW Giving Day is here (starting at noon on October 23rd), and WYOBIRD is hoping to get your help in raising funds to support training undergraduates and providing more outreach opportunities to the public.\nWith the funds that we raised last year, we were able to pay for 14 undergraduate interns! We had 8 interns who gained skills in banding birds at our migratory banding station here in Laramie. We had another six undergraduates work with us over the summer on a nest box study at Hutton NWR. And WYOBIRD funding to University of Wyoming faculty supported undergraduate field research in Panama!\nThis year, we are hoping to earn more support from you and raise enough funds to pay even more undergraduate interns. We want undergraduate student at UW to have the opportunity to gain important hands-on wildlife skills while not having the stress of having a separate, paid job.\nPlease help us support the experiential learning that WYOBIRD provides to UW’s undergraduates!\nVisit our campaign page\nWhether you are able to contribute money (even $1 helps!) or to just spread this widely on social media, we appreciate your support! Thank you for your support! Hope to see you out at one of our outreach events soon!"

    "text": "Most WYOBIRD faculty, staff, and students are housed in the Department of Zoology and Physiology under the College of Agriculture, Life Sciences and Natural Resources. However, WYOBIRD is open to all students interested in studying birds and we collaborate with people, labs, and schools within and beyond the University of Wyoming. We offer internships for undergraduates where they gain UW credit hours while assisting with field projects in the Laramie area. See the Get Involved page for more information on how to participate in WYOBIRD.\nFaculty and their students conduct research on a diversity of avian species and habitats within the state of Wyoming as well as in locations far beyond such as Panama and Hawaii. Projects examine questions on community structure, seed dispersal networks, hybrid zones, migratory movements, long-term demographic trends, impacts of energy development, animal communication, window collisions, avian parasites and more. Check out the faculty lab websites for more information on their work and how to join their labs."

Some undergraduates work on the Hutton Nest Box Study during the Summer, while others spend a few mornings in Laramie capturing and banding birds. Recently, WYOBIRD Faculty have used funds to support undergraduate field research in Wyoming, Hawaii, and in central Panama. Many of the WYOBIRD labs always have opening for volunteer positions to let you get your foot into the research door. These projects may involve tasks as varied as bioacoustic analysis, image analysis, or reviewing and annotating videos or images for machine learning tasks,\nJoin us today!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“This internship gives me actual experience with the concepts I am trying to learn in class. I am a kinesthetic learner, so this project is a golden opportunity to truly understand how this career looks in the field and how my lecture topics are related.”\n— T.T.

    "text": "UW Giving Day starts today (October 23, 2025) at noon!\nHelp WYOBIRD support training undergraduates and providing more outreach opportunities to the public! Last year, your contributions helped support hands-on training of 25 undergraduates!\nContribute to our campaign\n\n\n\n\nThe Wyoming Bird Initiative for Resilience and Diversity (WYOBIRD) is based out of the University of Wyoming. Our mission is to advance knowledge, appreciation, and conservation of birds locally and globally and we achieve this by conducting novel research on birds, training a new generation of scientists, and sharing science through public outreach. WYOBIRD seeks to understand how birds respond to a changing world and to build resilience in the field of ornithology. We promote all aspects of diversity, from the diversity of avian species and research approaches to the people conducting research.\n\nTraditional university coursework often does not include a field component yet students often need basic field skills to secure employment or advanced degrees (MS or PhD). With WYOBIRD we support avian research at the University of Wyoming, while offering internships, workshops, and outreach activities that expose students to field and quantitative methods used to study and conserve birds. We also build community by supporting meetups with avian researchers beyond UW. Check out our Projects and Activities pages to learn more about what we achieve with WYOBIRD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“WYOBIRD has been such an exciting new initiative with which to be affiliated. Apart from providing students with opportunities to learn from other faculty and students conducting research on birds, getting to observe the excitement of students handling wild birds for the first time is very meaningful. We look forward to growing WYOBIRD and expanding our efforts to include public outreach that will hopefully increase awareness about the plight of declining birds, both locally and worldwide.”\n— Anna Chalfoun (Associate Director of WYOBIRD)"

(undergraduate intern, Fall 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Gaining experience in the field I want to pursue while in University 100% makes my experience so much better. Working on projects like this make me want my degree all that much more!”\n— H.W. (undergraduate intern, Fall 2024)\n\n\n\n\nWith WYOBIRDhope to attract diverse students interested in birds and wildlife to UW while providing existing students with resources. Our local projects allow UW students to gain hands-on experience with bird research in an accessible way close to home. Students involved in WYOBIRD are exposed to field techniques such as bird capture and handling, nest monitoring, data management, project logistics, habitat sampling, behavioral observations, science communication, and more while contributing to research on birds within and beyond Wyoming. Each field season we support avian interns who assist with our local projects. Students learn valuable skills and gain UW university credit for their time. We hope to train and mentor several interns each fall and actively fundraise so that we can provide paid internships in the future. See the Support Us! page to help us meet this goal!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n\n\nFall Migration Bird Banding\n\n\n\n\n\nresearch\n\n\nIn fall 2023 we began a project to capture and band migratory birds passing through Laramie, a region that lacks information on songbird species whose populations are steeply declining. We monitor these birds on a property managed by the City of Laramie. At the banding station graduate students and faculty train UW undergraduate interns who earn college-level credit while learning how to handle, band, and measure wild birds. We hope to provide outreach visits to the banding station in future years so that community members can learn about avian research and come away with an appreciation for birds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n\n\nTree Swallow Nest Box Monitoring\n\n\n\n\n\nresearch\n\n\nDuring summer we monitor tree swallow nest boxes in Albany County. Undergraduate students have the opportunity to observe and record data from nest building to chick fledging while thinking critically about the scientific process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
