UW Giving Day is here (starting at noon on October 23rd), and WYOBIRD is hoping to get your help in raising funds to support training undergraduates and providing more outreach opportunities to the public.

With the funds that we raised last year, we were able to pay for 14 undergraduate interns! We had 8 interns who gained skills in banding birds at our migratory banding station here in Laramie. We had another six undergraduates work with us over the summer on a nest box study at Hutton NWR. And WYOBIRD funding to University of Wyoming faculty supported undergraduate field research in Panama!

This year, we are hoping to earn more support from you and raise enough funds to pay even more undergraduate interns. We want undergraduate student at UW to have the opportunity to gain important hands-on wildlife skills while not having the stress of having a separate, paid job.

Please help us support the experiential learning that WYOBIRD provides to UW's undergraduates!

Whether you are able to contribute money (even \$1 helps!) or to just spread this widely on social media, we appreciate your support! Thank you for your support! Hope to see you out at one of our outreach events soon!
