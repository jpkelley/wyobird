research: "WYOBIRD also aims to provide new quantitative skills for students, as well as faculty, by facilitating on-campus workshops that cover cutting-edge themes. In fall 2023, this included a workshop led by invited instructors from Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology on analyzing eBird datasets. In Spring 2024, Dr. Gabe Barille (UW) gave a multi-day workshop on using the package RMark for demographic analysis."
