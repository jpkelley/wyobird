research: "
In fall 2023 we began a project to capture and band migratory birds passing through Laramie, a region that lacks information on songbird species whose populations are steeply declining. We monitor these birds on a property managed by the City of Laramie. At the banding station graduate students and faculty train UW undergraduate interns who earn college-level credit while learning how to handle, band, and measure wild birds. We hope to provide outreach visits to the banding station in future years so that community members can learn about avian research and come away with an appreciation for birds."
