research: "WYOBIRD provides opportunities for students to engage in networking and discussion that can spur critical thinking and help build lasting human connections or collaborative relationships. We host invited speakers and hold in-person meetups with ornithologists from UW and external research groups. These outlets provide students with exposure to diverse topics, techniques, and tools used in avian research while establishing community with fellow students and scientists.

In Fall 2023, WYOBIRD hosted the inaugural Front Range Ornithology Conference, which was attended by 37 ornithologists from the region, including eight faculty-level scientists, three post-graduate researchers, and 26 graduate students. These individuals represented University of Wyoming (17), Colorado State University (11), University of Northern Colorado (5), University of Colorado-Boulder (3), and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science (1)."
